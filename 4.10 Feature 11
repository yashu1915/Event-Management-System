Register for an event by providing user ID and event ID. First check if the event exists. If not print out a message saying wrong event ID. Then check whether the event is full. If so, put the user on the wait list with the next position and print out a message saying you are on waitlist and the waitlist position. Otherwise register the user with the event and print a message you are registered.
