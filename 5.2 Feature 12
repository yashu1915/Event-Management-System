Cancel an event registration by providing user ID and event ID. Please check whether the event exists and the user has indeed registered. If the user is registered, delete the registration and register the first person on the waitlist (if the wait list is not empty). Generate a message (insert into message table) for the current user saying event canceled. If a user on top of wait list is now registered, generate a message to that user saying that he or she is now registered with the event.
